    "### User Needs Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of actual R language users, we explored common needs that might arise when processing BC Laws legal texts. For researchers or students, obtaining and using legal texts typically presents the following difficulties: the need to manually access web pages, download or copy texts, inconsistent data formats, and difficulty in integrating with common data analysis workflows in R. Therefore, users often want to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quickly find relevant laws by keywords, year, or law type\n",
    "\n",
    "- obtain legal text in a structured, easy-to-read format\n",
    "\n",
    "- naturally convert legal text into data frames for subsequent processing, statistics, or visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- complete the entire process from data acquisition to result display using the simplest and most intuitive function interfaces possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these needs, this project focuses on how to combine the raw API data provided by BC Laws with the tidy data workflow familiar to R users, rather than interpreting or evaluating the legal content itself."

    "### Project Scope and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "During the exploration process, we also clarified the scope and potential limitations of this project. First, this project uses a keyword-based text retrieval method, which cannot capture the semantic relationships or contextual meaning within legal provisions, and therefore is unsuitable for complex legal interpretation or policy analysis. Second, BC Laws' legal texts are typically long and structurally complex; this project focuses only on basic text retrieval and simple summarization, without involving advanced analytical methods such as natural language processing or text modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, due to the potential differences in format and length among different legal documents, the project did not attempt to handle all possible edge cases during the exploration phase, but instead prioritized building a lightweight, reproducible, and easily extensible workflow. If needed in the future, the project can be further expanded in terms of functionality, but such expansion is not within the scope of this project."

    "### Conceptual Workflow Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we did not run concrete code experiments during the exploration phase, we still explored how an R user would realistically interact with BC Laws data through a simple thought experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We imagined the following typical workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user knows the type and ID of a statute and calls a single high-level function in R to retrieve its contents.\n",
    "2. The function returns a tibble where each row corresponds to a section, including fields such as section identifier, heading, text, and source URL.\n",
    "3. The user can then filter or search this tibble by keyword, and select only the relevant columns for further analysis or reporting.\n",
    "4. Finally, the user can export the filtered results or integrate them into an R Markdown document.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this idea more concrete, we sketched the following conceptual R usage (this was **not implemented or executed** during the exploration phase, but served as a design reference):\n",
